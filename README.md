## ⛓️What is Web3?⛓️
Web3 represents a new vision for the internet, emphasizing decentralization and user empowerment. Unlike traditional Web2, where data is controlled by centralized corporations, Web3 uses blockchain-based networks of independent nodes to validate and store transactions. This ensures transparency, security, and gives users greater control over their data, identity, and online interactions.

## 🔐Login using Vipps vs Metamask🔐
In Web3, users interact through wallets that manage identity and access using cryptographic keys - not by storing assets. Each account has a public key for transactions and a private key that proves ownership. If the private key is lost, access to the account is gone permanently. To make onboarding easier, we offer Vipps Login as a familiar alternative to wallets like MetaMask, helping newcomers get started while still supporting full control for experienced users.

## 🪙What are transactions?🪙
In Web3, transactions are actions like sending assets or interacting with apps, and they require approval with your private key. Each transaction includes a gas fee, paid to the network for processing. Some transactions involve smart contracts — self-executing programs on the blockchain. In this game, you'll interact with a smart contract to run the game logic.

## 💸🔥 Does this mean I will be using money to play the game?💸🔥
No! Using Vipps or MetaMask won’t cost you anything. This game runs on Sepolia, an Ethereum test network where the ETH is fake and has no real value. It’s a safe space to explore blockchain features without spending real money - so you can play freely, risk-free.

## ✨Our goal...✨
We’re exploring how new users interact with a Web3 application and what barriers might hinder adoption. To make onboarding easier, we’ve integrated Vipps Login as a familiar alternative to wallets like MetaMask, helping users get started without needing to understand complex blockchain concepts.
